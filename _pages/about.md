Welcome to my homepage!

I am an associate professor at the Cyberspace Institute of Advanced Technology (Fang Class), Guangzhou University. I received my Ph.D. from the School of Computer Science at University College Cork  under the supervision of [Prof. Ken Brown](http://www.cs.ucc.ie/%7Ekb11/) in 2021 (Cork, Ireland). Before joining in University College Cork, I was a Research Engineer in Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academic of Science in [Prof. Yong Zhang](https://hpcc.siat.ac.cn/homepage/zhangy.html)'s group. I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow in Cyberspace Institute of Advanced Technology at Guangzhou University, working with [Prof. Zhihong Tian](https://wyy.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1160/1560.htm) from 2021 to 2023. 


Research Interests
======
1. Clustering Algorithm in Resource Constrained Network.
2. Inference Learning and Intelligent Decision-making in Wireless Networks.
3. Distributed Learning and Federated Learning with  Multi-modal Data.
4. Privacy and Security Protection in Distributed Learning.

Hobbies
======
1.  Running and traveling give me good relaxation apart from doing research.
2.  Playing dota2 is also a good option to kill time. Wraith King and Juggernaut are my favorite melee carries and I also prefer to play supports (i.e., Lion and  Witch Doctor). For sure, I can support if you wanna carry the game.
