Welcome to my homepage!

I am an associate professor at the Cyberspace Institute of Advanced Technology, Guangzhou University. I received my Ph.D. from the School of Computer Science at University College Cork (Ireland) under the supervision of [Prof. Ken Brown](http://www.cs.ucc.ie/%7Ekb11/) in 2021. I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow in Cyberspace Institute of Advanced Technology at Guangzhou University, working with [Prof. Zhihong Tian](https://wyy.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1160/1560.htm) from 2021 to 2023. Before joining in University College Cork, I was a research engineer in Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academic of Science, working with [Prof Yong Zhang](https://hpcc.siat.ac.cn/homepage/zhangy.html). 



Research Interests
======
I am broadly interested in problems/scenarios: crowdsourcing/crowdsensing, federated learning, incentive mechanism, bandit and AI security. 
I focus on theoretical research using tools including optimization and machine/deep learning.
